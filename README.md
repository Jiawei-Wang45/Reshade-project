# Reshade-project
Introduction:\
  Here are two filters effect created by me on Reshade. One is Edge detection based on depth and another is the fog simulation. Details about implementation are shown in respective pdf documents. You can check out to see basic principle and inspiration behind them.

How to use:\
  First install Reshade for your game. Inside your root directory of game, find a folder named "reshade-shaders". Click into it, just simply copy two .fx files and put them into "Shaders" folder. Remember to put three noise textures(png files) into "Textures" folder, otherwise the fog filter won't work correctly.

简单介绍：\
  在Reshade里编写了了两个滤镜效果，一个是基于深度的边缘检测，另一个是模拟雾效。细节在各自的pdf文件中展示，包括基本的设计思路和灵感
  
怎么使用：\
  首先为你的游戏安装Reshade。在游戏根目录文件夹下找到"reshade-shaders"文件夹并双击进入，然后将两个.fx文件复制粘贴到"Shaders"文件夹下，记得要将三张噪声纹理(png图片)放入"Textures"文件夹下
